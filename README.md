# simplisp
a meta recursive interpreter

Includes trace options, but with Racket CS the options\
trace-value trace-assgn and trace-varef\
cannot be used when simplisp traces its own source code.

Works well with Racket BC and Racket versions up to and including 7.9.\
Problems with parameterization with Racket CS 8.0 and up.
